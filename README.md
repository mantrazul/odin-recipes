## What were the challenges?

1. The first challenge was to build a proper README.md. I was using HTML formatting for it until I realized that it worked with **_Markdown_**. This is visible in the first commit, will leave it there as a lesson to be learned.

2. After finishing the project, there weren't a lot of difficulties. I ended up reading more html documentation, in particular the **anchor** tag to have a better understanding on how to use it. In the end it was a simple project.
